# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION LEMP STACK

Welcome back! In project one, we focused on deploying the LAMP stack, in this project we'll hone in on LEMP. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents:

**L** –– Linux Operating System >> An operating system that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop, a.k.a., the communication between your software and hardware

**E** –– Nginx Server **(pronounced as engine-x)** >> A high-preforming web server that enables the processing of many requests at the same time

**M** –– MySQL Database >> An open-source relational database management system

**P** –– PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)

The Nginix server used in this project, is the main difference in LEMP versus LAMP.

## LINUX

### Setting up your virtual environment

We'll need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS. If you don't have one already, follow the steps in my [LAMP Stack](https://github.com/eakanbi80/web-stack-implementation-lamp) project to create a free tier AWS account.

Once you have successfully signed-in to your AWS account, navigate to the top-right of the screen and select your preferred region––this should be the closest region to your physical location.
